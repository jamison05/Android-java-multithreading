-Starting some of the small projects for a larger project that deals with a very complicated game integrally coordinated to sound.
-It will be similar to the creative taste II Android Program with a better user interface and user experience, enhanced graphics and 
-coordinated sound programming.  I will will also be using the google sound cloud to store both graphics and a complex sounds.  

One of the folders is basically a previous program using the Java Beads library to create very complex sound altering panning and other atributes
I will use the various functions of that libary to perform real-time sound processing in Android to coordinate with user experience.

1. I first have to test OPEN GLES graphics and sound processing together with possible expresso user testing to see if the program will be proned to 
crashes, or will be too draining on battery life.  Sound framework design may can accomodate the pitfalls or whether I can do multithreaded preprocessing,
or only use sound processing less than 25% reducing strain on the batter.  I will als

2.  I will design the sound architecture very differently.
